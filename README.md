- Am I a machine without feelings? Do you think that because I am poor, obscure, plain and little that I am souless and heartless? I have as much as soul as you and full as much herat. And if God had blessed me with beauty and wealth, I could make it as hard fou you to leave me as it is for I to leave you. I'm not speaking to you through mortal flesh. It is my spirit that addresses your spirit, as if we'd passed through the grave and stood at God's feet, equal, as we are. —— Jane Eyre
